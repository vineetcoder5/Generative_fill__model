# Generative_fill_model

Work in Progress

This project endeavors to automate the task of filling blank spaces in an image by leveraging an outline image supplied by the user. The outline image functions as a roadmap, delineating the specific areas requiring filling within the image.

To achieve this, the project utilizes the tf.keras.datasets.cifar10.load_data() dataset for training the model. By training on this dataset, which consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, the model learns to understand various visual features and patterns present in images. This understanding enables it to effectively fill in the designated areas in a given image while maintaining visual coherence and fidelity.

Through advanced deep learning techniques, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and generative adversarial networks (GANs), the model learns to interpret the outline image provided by the user and generate plausible content to fill the corresponding blank spaces. By iteratively refining its predictions during training, the model gradually improves its ability to generate realistic and contextually appropriate image completions.
